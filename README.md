# Viewing Party API

## Project Summary

This project involved developing the front-end of a movie review application using React.
The primary focus was on fetching data from our backend API, managing it within state, and dynamically rendering the UI based on user interactions.
We implemented React Router to enable seamless navigation across different views, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.
To maintain reliability and functionality, we incorporated Cypress testing to validate key user stories and interactions.
Additionally, we applied CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the application.
This project required a combination of state management, routing, testing, and UI development to create a polished and functional front-end experience.
